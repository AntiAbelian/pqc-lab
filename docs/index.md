# PQC Lab

Welcome to my personal notebook for **Post-Quantum Cryptography**.

This site is a living, modular, experimental space where I document:

- 🧩 **Preliminaries** - Background and foundations
- 🏗️ **PQC Fields** - Families (lattice, code-based, hash-based, etc.)
- 🔐 **Algorithms** - Concrete schemes (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+, etc.)
- ⚙️ **Implementation** - Techniques, optimizations, side-channels
- 🧪 **Experiments** - Empirical tinkering and intuition-building
- 🛠️ **Tools** - Scripts, notebooks, utilities

!!! note "Philosophy"
    This is not a textbook. It's modular, playful, and honestly messy. 
    The goal is to build intuition, not perfection.
